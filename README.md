# alpha-project

Alpha Project is a project for creating a **template of Online Store's REST API.** This template will be used for me to create many client's online store. So in the future whenever I have a new client, I don't need to create from the scratch again. 

This API will be created using microservice architecture in order to make easier for me in the future to add new requirements/features/ services for this project.
